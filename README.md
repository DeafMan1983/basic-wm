WARNING FOR C# not C++

I port from C++ [basic_wm](https://github.com/jichu4n/basic_wm) to C# with package [TerraFX.Interop.Xlib](https://github.com/terrafx/terrafx.interop.xlib)

But I need find to resolve my problem because client_.count(w), .erase(w) and std::find() I don't know how do I port to C#

I hope you know that.
